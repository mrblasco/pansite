120710%Introduction to My Book%book-introduction.html%July 10, 2012%Tue, 10 Jul 2012 00:00:00 EDT%<p>On April 14, 1865, hours before Abraham Lincoln sat down for the last time at Ford’s Theater in Washington, D.C., the famous abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison sat down for the first time in Charleston, South Carolina. More than three decades before, Garrison had founded the Boston <em>Liberator,</em> a newspaper dedicated to universal, immediate slave emancipation. In 1833, he helped found the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS), a group devoted to the same goal. And by the time he went to Charleston, Garrison had served as the society’s president for over twenty years. Only in the last few, however, had emancipation changed from a despised, minority opinion to the official policy of federal armies in a cataclysmic civil war. With the war now ending and a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery awaiting ratification, Garrison had come to Fort Sumter to attend a flag-raising ceremony at the invitation of Lincoln’s administration.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

150428%Lewis Perry's Civil Disobedience%civil-disobedience-review.html%April 28, 2015%Tue, 28 Apr 2015 00:00:00 EDT%<p>Over the last sixty years, numerous reformers have laid claim to what the antiwar activist Philip Berrigan called, in 1968, “a rich tradition of civil disobedience” in American history (25). Often, such activists have even claimed that civil disobedience is a civil right inherent to the American democratic tradition itself. “Such claims were not stated so clearly before the 1960s,” notes Lewis Perry in his wide-ranging, fascinating narrative of the evolution of civil disobedience (25). But the notion that civil disobedience was a shared heritage of all Americans “remained strong” in the anti-nuclear and anti-abortion protests of the 1970s and 1980s, and continues to surface today (304).</p>

And by “large collection,” I mean <em>large</em>. According to the library’s estimates, there are over 16,000 items at Copley, many of which I pored over in three separate trips to Boston while writing my dissertation and book.</p>

120724%Trusting the Water Cure%trusting-water-cure.html%July 24, 2012%Tue, 24 Jul 2012 00:00:00 EDT%<p>Historians of the early republic now understand a great deal about how the post office, the steam engine, the telegraph, and the printing press helped to stitch a growing nation together while simultaneously connecting Americans to a wider world. The “water cure,” a nineteenth-century health reform movement also known as hydropathy, was in many ways the perfect example of how an antebellum “communications revolution” created extensive information networks on even the most obscure topics. After its genesis in Austria in the 1830s and 1840s, by the 1850s the “water cure” claimed a transatlantic following with devotees as diverse as Charles Darwin, Stonewall Jackson, David Ruggles, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and a host of unknown clients from Russia, Germany, Italy, and beyond. By the beginning of the Civil War, the New York City newspaper, <em>The Water-Cure Journal</em>, claimed tens of thousands of subscribers, and over 200 hydropathic establishments dotted the country from upstate New York, to Biloxi, Mississippi, and Salem, Oregon.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
