I delivered a version of these comments as part of a <a href="https://aha.confex.com/aha/2015/webprogram/Session12225.html">roundtable at the AHA 2015 meeting</a> in New York City, which posed the question, "Whither the History Major?" My comments focused on what the history major looks like in a "digital age." In the delivered talk, I focus more on how "capstone" projects might change to reflect digital changes in the landscape of history.

In a recent essay in *The American Scholar*, Anthony Grafton and James
Grossman gave a [ringing defense of the value of history][] in the
undergraduate curriculum, reserving special praise for what they
described as the "quaint" but essential practice of engaging students in
the art of archival research. As they noted, in many universities,
something like a "term paper" or original thesis remains the primary
capstone experience for a history major, and with good reason.

I was reminded of the good reasons over the last two days while
following AHA panels on Twitter from Houston, using the conference
hashtag \#aha2015. Several panels here have provided preliminary reports
on the [AHA's Tuning project][], which seeks to identify the key skills
and concepts that we, as historians, hope our history majors will learn
by the time they graduate. Many of these learning objectives---finding
sources, weighing evidence, constructing argument-driven
narratives---are skills that traditional "term papers" and theses are
still good at teaching and assessing.

Yet in between tweets about teaching and Tuning panels, my timeline also
teemed with creative examples of digital history that vastly expand
traditional notions of what archives, evidence, and scholarship can be.
These panels, not to mention the fact that I was following them on a
social media platform, bore witness (as if more were needed) to our
"digital age," an age in which both the process of historical research
and the communication of its results increasingly occurs online or in
some other digital form.

Set aside for a moment whether this "digital age" is a blessing or a
curse, and consider only the evidence that it is upon us. A [Pew survey of
middle-school and high-school teachers from 2012][] found that just 12
percent said their students were "very likely" to consult printed books
for a typical research assignment, while 94 percent said students were
"very likely" to turn to Google. I see little reason to think those
percentages have reversed in three years, especially since other
evidence suggests [professional historians are also increasingly prone
to begin their research online][] or in digital databases. Indeed, in
their defense of the continued relevance of requiring "term papers in
our courses, and ... independent work and BA theses of our majors,"
Grafton and Grossman themselves turn for evidence to a series of
departmental webpages and digital archives that showcase student
work.^[Though I'm using Grafton and Grossman as a reference point here,
it's worth noting that both authors have been staunch allies and
advocates of creative digital history scholarship. In what follows, I'm
not going to pick a bone with them here so much as extend their points
in this particular essay farther than they do in this particular essay.]

Those same webpages, and many others, suggest to me that the history major
will not wither in a digital age. But whither will it tend? The ubiquity of
digital tools and media in our and our students' lives do raise the question of
whether, as we and our majors increasingly *use* digital forms of history, we
will in equal measure increase our attention to teaching them how to *make*
digital historical narratives and archives.

Let me be clear at this point about what I do not want to say. I do not
want to set up a false either/or choice, as though the history major
must either continue to focus on mastering traditional tasks such as
research papers *or* become more adept at navigating and using digital
tools. Grossman and Grafton explained much better than I could why
traditional archival research and research papers still matter and
probably will long after we're gone.

But I do think that accounting for the "digital age" in our design of
history major goals and assessments will require more than training
students in something like "how to evaluate webpages" when doing
research for a paper, which I think is still too often where it is
easiest to stop. That's a valuable thing to teach majors---don't get me
wrong---and we could probably always do more of it. But it's a framing
based on an abstraction---"webpages"---that may not actually exist in
the wild. (Is Twitter a "webpage"? Is the Digital Public Library of
America? Is *The New York Times*?)

Focusing on teaching students how to *use* information from the Web also
considers the Web narrowly as a *place where evidence for a research paper
might be found*, instead of all of the other things it is: a place where people
watch "Drunk History" episodes, annotate historical photographs, follow history
Twitter feeds, conduct genealogical research, organize protests informed by
historical analogies and precedents, argue about historical claims with friends
and relatives on Facebook, discuss historical documentaries or books as they
watch or read them in real time, encounter historical artifacts and exhibits
curated by museums, and increasingly interact directly with historians in
blogs, comment sections, Reddit threads, social media, and more. An increasing
amount and variety of history happens on the Web; what possibilities does that
open up for our thinking about a "major" in this field?

Before turning it over to you, I'll offer a few quick answers, none of
which are revolutionary or original to me, but all of which I often
ponder. The first is that if we are not in some way teaching history
majors how to *make* digital stuff as well as to *use* it, we are
leaving them ill-equipped to share their hard-won historical skills and
knowledge in the arena where many of them are most likely to encounter
claims and conversations about history.^[Mills Kelly is one of the most
eloquent recent defenders of [making][] as an essential part of history
curricula.]

It's clear to me, moreover, that *making* digital history requires
knowledge of more than the technical know-how to upload traditional
forms of history like a term paper or thesis to the Internet. A linear
narrative in a double-spaced, ten-page, one-inch margins research is not
the same as a layered narrative of the sort that I encountered following
the \#aha2015 hashtag the last two days. Knowing how to craft the one
(however valuable that continues to be) is not the same as knowing how
to craft the other. A hyperlink is not just a footnote by another name,
and knowing how to format the latter does not mean knowing how to format
and effectively deploy the former. Mounting a persuasive historical
argument aimed at scholars is not the same as winning an argument about
history on Facebook. All of which is to say that even if the ability to
"craft historical narrative" is one of the goals of a history major, as
the AHA History Tuning Project suggests, we need to recognize that
crafting digital narratives often requires a different set of
competencies than those required by a "written or oral presentation."

That's not to say, however, that there is no overlap between the
competencies students attain by writing a term paper and by crafting a
digital narrative in some form. On the contrary. As the [historian Eric
Rauchway recently observed][], the recently concluded, wildly popular
podcast Serial, in which a radio journalist reported week by week on her
investigation of a murder case, actually offered "a pretty good
dramatization of the historical process," and with "a compelling
narrative" besides. And [Benjamin G. Wright has had success teaching
students the basic concept of historiography][] by having them examine
the "history" tab of a Wikipedia page. Such examples, and I could cite
many others, raise the question of whether the capstone project of a
history major or independent study could be something like a podcast or
a Wikipedia page, instead of only something like a paper. To cite a
final example out of many possible ones, Michelle Moravec uses
[Pinterest][] and an assignment in which students [live-tweet as a
historical figure][moravec].^[See more digitally inflected assignments on
Moravec's [Pinterest board on digital assignments][].]

If such digital work can help instructors assess learning outcomes while
simultaneously preparing history majors to "do history" in the same
arena where they probably do most of their writing already, why not? And
to conclude with a more affirmative reason why *so*, I believe such
capstone projects could have the added benefit of helping students to
understand the historical situatedness of digital tools themselves. One
reason we have relied on term papers, as Grafton and Grossman note, is
that "it's the only way for a student to get past being a passive
consumer and critic [of historical narratives] and to become a creator,
someone who reads other historians in the light of having tried to do
what they do."

I'd like to stress that last phrase, because I think it could stand as a
good ideal definition of a graduate with a history major, too: *someone
who reads other historians in the light of having tried to do what they
do.* By the same logic, if we want our students to be more than passive
consumers of Wikipedia or Twitter or podcasts or "Drunk History" videos,
we'll do more than teach them how to evaluate a website's reliability
and format a citation to it in a footnote. We'll encourage them to
become a digital creator, someone who consumes digital resources in the
light of having tried to do what their makers do---and *tried* is key
here, lest we fail to start teaching digital history out of a false
belief that we have to show a student how to do all of it in order to do
any of it.

Through the process of writing a Wikipedia page, or engaging in a
Twitter debate, far more than by reading about these media, considering
warnings about Google, or simply incorporating websites into a paper,
students will come to appreciate that these media are themselves in the
stream of time and have their own specific and [sometimes sordid
histories][]. And in so doing, history majors in the digital age may
more fully achieve another of the learning outcomes identified by the
[AHA History Tuning Project][AHA's Tuning project], which is for
students to "recognize where they are in history."
