History courses usually have heavy reading loads. But you can make the
load lighter if you develop effective strategies for reading. This page
is designed to introduce history students to some of those strategies,
but these tips are not the last word on reading effectively. Hone your
own reading strategies. Practice different strategies over periods of
time. And be sure to consult [the advice of others][] about how to read.

[*Please note:* The advice on this page pertains mainly to "secondary"
texts written by historians. Some of the tips may also be helpful when
reading "primary" historical documents, but reading primary sources
effectively often requires a unique set of skills. For example, this
page recommends active skimming as an effective reading tool, but
primary source documents often cannot and should not be skimmed as
easily. So the tools described on this page are intended primarily to
help you read scholarly works about history.]

Reading as Conversation
-----------------------

It may seem like reading is a solitary art. But reading a history book
is better thought of as a conversation. The author of the book wants to
*tell* you, the reader, something that he or she thinks is important and
true. The author is never just conveying information, but also trying to
*convince* you of his or her interpretation of the past. If it seems to
you like all an author is trying to do is pass along some facts, even
then be aware that there is more going on: implicitly the author is
still trying to *persuade* you that *these* facts are important and that
they are related to each other in a particular way.

*Tell*, *convince*, *persuade*: these are words we tend to use when
describing conversations, speeches, arguments. But these words are just
as appropriate when we talk about history books or articles or essays.
**All works of history contain arguments**--even the ones that appear to
be nothing more than good yarns. So your ultimate task as a reader will
be to identify what the argument of the book or article is.

In some works of scholarship, the main argument is easier to find than
in others. For instance, sometimes an author's main argument is that
some other scholar has made a mistake in interpreting the past. And in
the process of detailing their differences or agreements with other
historians, authors often spell out their own argument or thesis
explicitly. So whenever a scholar mentions another scholar or body of
scholarship, your antennae as a reader should immediaely go up: the main
argument of the book may be nearby.

But whether or not an author is primarily addressing other authors, he
or she is always addressing you as well. The author is trying to
convince *you* that the book's central arguments are correct. Realizing
that fact--that the author wants to engage you in argument and
conversation--is the crucial first step you must make as a critical
reader.

And a second fact is even more important to realize: *you do not have to
be convinced by an author's arguments*. An author's reasons for reaching
a given conclusion may be flawed or partial or incomplete. But if you
are not convinced by an author's argument, as a thoughtful reader you
will have to offer your own good reasons for disagreeing or withholding
judgment. That's why, to emphasize the point again, critical reading is
conversational: the author starts the conversation by trying to convince
the reader of something, and the reader continues the conversation by
formulating arguments with or posing questions to the author.

The Three Stages of Reading
---------------------------

Of course, before you can decide whether you agree with an author's
argument, you have to identify and analyze it. And in that process, you
will be most successful if you break the act of reading into at least
three parts.

First, whether you are reading a long book or a short essay, you should
always ***skim*** your reading material to gather information about the
structure and major points of a text. As we will see, skimming involves
more than running your eyes across a page. It is a dynamic process in
which you not only gather information from a text but also formulate
questions that you will want to have answered when you move to the next
stage of reading. Skimming is one of the most important stages in
reading, yet it is probably the most misunderstood and least practiced.
For that reason, I have dedicated the bulk of this guide to skimming.

Only after skimming will you give a text the ***slow read***. But the
second stage of reading entails more than just running your eyes over
the words more slowly than you did while skimming. When you slow-read a
book you will also be writing (taking notes), recalling (by constantly
looking back to the information you learned by skimming), and reviewing
(by pausing at the end of each section of a text to make sure you have
grasped its main point).

The third stage of reading begins after the actual act of reading has
ended. In the ***post read*** you will reflect back on what you have
read and evaluate the arguments that the author has advanced.

Stage 1: The Skim
-----------------

The following tips on skimming are based upon a fundamental idea,
adapted from the book *[Style: Toward Clarity and Grace][]*, by Joseph
Williams. Williams argues that clear writing comes from thinking about
how readers read. Conversely, clear-headed reading comes from thinking
about how writers write. Your goal as a skimmer is to grasp as quickly
as possible what a writer is trying to say, what he or she wants to
convince you of. This means trying to sit in the writer's chair. Here
are some ideas about how to do that.

Tip \#1: **Always "pre-read" by skimming the titles, both for the whole
work and for sections.** When authors choose titles, they are attempting
to do your work as a skimmer for you. Titles, ideally, boil down crucial
concepts into brief phrases, and they can give important clues about a
work's argument. You should therefore look for key words in the title.
Then, while you are skimming, you can pay special attention to the parts
of the work that bear directly on those key words.

For instance, consider the book [The Cult of the Nation in France:
Inventing Nationalism, 1680-1800][], by David Bell. The title to this
book contains several clues about the main points of the book. On the
most basic level, it tells us that this is a book about nationalism in
France. It repeats forms of the word "nation" twice, so we know that
understanding the role of those words in the text is going to be one of
our major tasks as readers.

But we can also tell more than that. Look at the dates, "1680-1800." We
can infer from these that Bell believes that the invention of French
nationalism took place during the eighteenth century. As it turns out,
this is a major argument of the book, as we will discover once we begin
to slow-read. Bell disagrees with histories or theories of nationalism
that make it an ancient phenomenon; the dates alone tell us that he
thinks nationalism is a relatively modern development. But he also
disagrees with people who think that French nationalism burst on the
scene only during the French Revolution in 1788 and 1789. The title
asserts that nationalism was being invented long before the Revolution,
which is again a major argument of the book. Even if we do not know
anything about these dates, however, we can note them down in the form
of a question to be answered when we slow-read the book: Why did the
author put *these* dates in the title?

We can learn even more from the title. Notice the words "cult" and
"inventing." These are clues that for Professor Bell, nationalism is
primarily a "cultural" phenomenon (hence "cult"), not merely a political
project. And because the nation is a cultural construction, Bell argues
that it had to be "invented"; nationalism is not automatic or an
inevitable product of people living together in the same space. These
will also turn out to be major arguments of the book, but we are
prepared for them just by looking at the title.

Before skimming a text, you should look not only at the title of the
whole work, but also at the titles of subsections. Scan the table of
contents. Find other key words. Make a note of whether some of the
title's key words are repeated in the table of contents; if so, that
means they will be doubly important. But also notice any new key words
*not*contained in the title; those concepts will also be important in
the book, but probably in a secondary way. When we look at Professor
Bell's table of contents, this is what we get:

Introduction: Constructing the Nation\
1. The National and the Sacred\
2. The Politics of Patriotism and National Sentiment\
3. English Barbarians, French Martyrs\
4. National Memory and the Canon of Great Frenchmen\
5. National Character and the Republican Imagination\
6. National Language and the Revolutionary Crucible\
Conclusion: Toward the Present Day and the End of Nationalism

"Constructing the Nation" reinforces our observations about "cult" and
"inventing" from the title, and the repetition of the word "nation" in
almost every chapter's title affirms that we will not understand this
book unless we understand what Professor Bell wants to tell us about
"nations" and "nationalism." The fact that "revolutionary crucible" does
not come until the last chapter confirms our suspicion that nationalism
was being built long before the 1780s. But there are also new words
here--"sacred," "memory," "character," "republican," "language." Now we
have some questions we can ask ourselves while reading: How do these
words and concepts relate to the primary concepts that we have already
identified? You should follow the same procedure when you get into
specific chapters. What are the subheadings for sections of the chapter?
What key words do *they* contain?

Tip \#2: **Look for main points "early" or "late."** Williams' book on
*Style* encourages writers to place their main points either at the
beginning of works or at the end, because this is where readers tend to
look for them. He's right, and this is where skimmers should go for
quick ideas about the main point of a book or article. The main points
of a book can usually be found in the introduction or conclusion.
Likewise, the main points of a chapter are usually at the beginning or
the end. In fact, the same is true even of smaller sections in a
chapter. The same is even true of paragraphs. If a writer is doing his
or her job well, you will not find the most important points of a
paragraph buried in the middle. You will find them in the two or three
sentences that come at the beginning or the end.

Slow-reading (as we will see below) is a linear practice. You start on
the first page, and read through to the last page. But skimming requires
a non-linear approach to reading. We've already seen this by discussing
how skimmers jump ahead to the titles of chapters before they have read
a single word. In the same way, skimmers try to think more like writers
than readers. And since they know that writers tend to place their
points "early" and "late," they go straight to those places and look
again for key words and lines.

If a book has them, start by reading the "introduction" and the
"conclusion." You should *always* read these sections carefully, even if
you skim everything else. Don't worry if you don't understand everything
yet. You're trying to do the same sort of thing you did with the
titles--identify key words, concepts that come up a lot, and major
arguments. Notice which key words and arguments in the introduction are
repeated in the conclusion. You can bet the house that those words and
arguments are essential for you to understand, even if it means paying
less attention while reading to other concepts and arguments. Also, keep
an eye out for obvious landmarks like "This book is about ..." or "I
will argue that ..." Again, these are the sentences in which the writer
does the job of skimming for you by boiling down his or her argument
into a concise statement.

Let's take some example sentences from Professor Bell's book:

> "This book is about the way in which the French came to think of their
> nation as a political construction and, furthermore, came to see the
> process of construction itself as a central task of political life"
> (p. 6).

> "Much of the book will be concerned with this pre-revolutionary
> change." (p. 7)
>
> "I will also argue that the dynamics that governed this story and made
> nationalism thinkable were principally cultural and religious in
> nature." (p. 7)

> "By 'nationalism' I mean a program to build a sovereign political
> community grouping together people who have enough in common--whether
> language, customs, beliefs, traditions, or some combination of
> these--to allow them to act as a homogeneous, collective person." (p.
> 20)

In each of these sentences, the author is waving flags at us, trying to
get us to notice key points. Not surprisingly, they all come "early" or
"late." All of them are from the introduction to the book. The first
three sentences are the first lines of paragraphs. The last sentence is
the last line of a paragraph, and comes at the end of the introduction.

So if we followed the "early"-and-"late" principle of skimming, we would
have noticed these sentences. And we also would be able to compare them
against our mental lists of key words and topics. The first sentence
reinforces the idea of "constructing" or "inventing" nationalism. The
second sentence reinforces that this happened *before* the Revolution.
The third sentence brings up "religion," which we can connect with the
word "sacred" in the title of Chapter 1. This tells us we should be on
the look-out for connections between nationalism and religion in Chapter
1. And the last sentence gives us some new key words--like "sovereign
political community," "enough in common," and "language," which we can
be looking for as the book progresses.

Once you have carefully read the "introduction" and the "conclusion,"
you are ready to start skimming. But as you skim, you will follow the
same practice. Instead of reading a chapter one page after another, read
the first and last pages of the chapter first. Then proceed through the
chapter. But don't read every paragraph line by line. Read the first
lines carefully, scan the middle, and then read the last lines
carefully. If an author does occasionally put important points in the
middle of a paragraph, and said author is also smart, he or she will
usually give you more obvious landmarks like "My point here is ..." or
"This suggests that ..."

As you see these landmarks, make a note of them, ideally by summarizing
the main points of each section and/or chapter in your notes. By the
time you have finished skimming the book, you should have a list or
outline of the book's major keywords or points. Once you move on to
later stages of reading, these notes will help remind you of the
information you collected while skimming.

Tip \#3: **Do not get hung up on things you do not understand.** This is
perhaps the most important part of skimming. Mortimer Adler and Charles
van Doren call it "superficial reading," a term they mean to be
"intentionally provocative." I wouldn't recommend their advice for every
kind of reading you do, but it applies perfectly to skimming:

> *In tackling a difficult book for the first time, read it through
> without ever stopping to look up or ponder the things that you do not
> understand right away.*Pay attention to what you can understand and do
> not be stopped by what you cannot immediately grasp. Go right on
> reading past the point where you have difficulties in understanding,
> and you will soon come to things you do understand. Concentrate on
> these. Keep on in this way. Read the book through, undeterred and
> undismayed by the paragraphs, footnotes, comments, and references that
> escape you. If you let yourself get stalled, if you allow yourself to
> be tripped up by any one of these stumbling blocks, you are lost. In
> most cases, you will not be able to puzzle the thing out by sticking
> to it. You will have a much better chance of understanding it on a
> second reading, but that requires you to have read the book *through*
> at least once. [From [*How to Read a Book*][], pp. 36-7.]

Why should you plow ahead through difficult passages while skimming?
Because otherwise you could get mired in arguments that are tangential
to the main point of the work. Unless you survive these passages and get
a view of the work as a whole, you won't be able to judge the
*important* difficult passages from the relatively unimportant ones.

Fortunately, if you have been following Tips 1 and 2 above, you are
already armed with ways to tell whether a difficult passage is important
to muddle through or not. Do the difficult words and arguments contain
any of the key words or ideas that you have gleaned from the titles? If
not, leave them aside for now. Are the troublesome parts in the "middle"
of the paragraph, chapter, or book, rather than "early" or "late"? If
so, pass over them for now and focus on the beginnings and endings of
the work.

Tip 3 does not mean you should blissfully skip over *any and all*
difficult passages or words. Far from it. Rather, you need to be able to
decide which parts to wrestle with, and which parts to come back to when
you move on to the slow-read. If a passage contains key words from the
titles, then you need to understand it, whether it is difficult or not.
If the difficult passages come up in the introduction and conclusion,
there's no easy way around them.

But you have to pick your battles when you are skimming. Don't get stuck
on difficult parts that are incidental to the larger points of the book
or article. Instead, note these passages with a question mark in the
margin. If you discover as you read on that these passages were
important to the overall work, you can always go back to them. But in
many cases you'll see that what seemed difficult at first becomes
clearer as you move along. Or you'll discover that it was not essential
to understand the difficult passage in order to understand the work as a
whole.

It should go without saying, however, that you should not dismiss a
passage as "difficult" just because it has big words that you don't
know. If the obstacle to understanding a passage is primarily
definitional, [get a dictionary][].

To sum up, skimming--the first stage of effective reading--does not just
mean reading faster. It means pre-reading and collecting key information
from titles. It means starting at the beginning and the end of sections,
the places of the work that are most likely to contain the major points.
And it means making intelligent decisions about when to dig deep into a
difficult passage, and when to move on and come back later.

Stage 2: The Slow Read
----------------------

By skimming a book you have hopefully started to identify some of its
main points. But now you will want to give the book a second, more
careful look.

Ideally, in the second stage of reading you should read every word
assigned. Realistically, that won't always be possible. That's why
skimming well was important: it should have helped you decide which
sections of the book are most important to read slowly and absorb.

The slow-read is probably the most straightforward and familiar stage of
reading. Three words sum up the basic point: *Read the book*. But as you
read, you should practice several good reading habits:

-   **Be on the look-out for reasons and evidence.** In the skimming
    stage you began to identify the main points of the book. Now you
    will want to identify the reasons, arguments, and evidence the
    author gives for why you should accept those main points as true.
-   **Ask yourself questions about the author's reasons and evidence.**
    Are there arguments you find suspect? Evidence you expected to be
    shown that the author is not including? Questions you have about
    whether a particular piece of evidence is representative or
    anomalous? Mistakes you see in an author's logical leaps?
-   **Selectively annotate the book with marginal notes or
    high-lights.** The main thing you will want to note are points where
    you think the author's arguments are particularly strong or
    particularly weak. These are the parts of the book you will be most
    interested in returning to once you begin to evaluate the work as a
    whole. ***Do not high-light excessively.*** If you do, you will have
    undermined the point of high-lighting in the first place: you want
    to emphasize only those lines or paragraphs that struck you as most
    crucial to the author's argument.
-   **Pause at the end of each section to review and jot notes.**
    Instead of taking exhaustive notes as you read, pause after each
    chapter or main section to write down a few reactions and record the
    questions you have been asking.

Stage 3: The Post-Read
----------------------

By the time you have completed Stages 1 and 2, you should know the main
*points* of the book, and you should also know the main reasons the
author gives to support those points. Now that you have "finished" the
book, your final task is to evaluate those reasons.

In evaluating the author's reasons, you will also be formulating your
own "points" about the book. In a history course, you will probably be
asked to share these "points" with your instructor or classmates, either
in class discussions or through written assignments. If you do not leave
the book with something to say in such forums, then the post-read is not
yet complete. Remember that reading well is an art of conversation, not
primarily an art of memorization. "Total recall" of all the details in a
book is not the most desired outcome when you are reading for history,
so don't spend the post-read period trying to memorize. It is better to
come to class with questions of your own about the book than with
answers to all an instructor's potential questions.

The post-read, then, is just the end of the beginning of reading. In
evaluating the book, you are preparing to continue the conversation that
the author has tried to start. By contributing to a class discussion or
writing a book review, you will become a kind of "author" yourself, who
will try to convince your own audience that your reasons for agreeing or
disagreeing with the book are valid. You will keep the conversation
going.
