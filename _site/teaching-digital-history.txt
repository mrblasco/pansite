These are the comments I prepared for a roundtable session on [Teaching
Digital History Methods for History Graduate
Students](http://aha.confex.com/aha/2013/webprogram/Session8610.html) at
the 2013 Annual Meeting of the AHA in New Orleans.

Last semester, I received some funding from my campus's Humanities
Research Center to run what the center calls a
[Masterclass](http://hrc.rice.edu/masterclass/)---a year-long,
one-credit special topics course in which both undergraduates and
graduates can enroll. [My masterclass
course](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu) is on digital history, but
in my case "masterclass" is a bit of a misnomer. I am far from having
"mastered" digital history, and have not yet made serious use of digital
history methods in my own research. My institution has no center in
digital history, and my department has no cluster of self-identifying
digital historians. The "masterclass" so far has basically been a
lecture series in which I have invited digital historians from
*off-campus* to speak about their methods and lead practical workshops
and discussions with my students.

I say all this to make clear that my experience in training graduate
students in digital history methods---the topic of this roundtable---is
limited. Other than the so-called "masterclass," my experience amounts
to having grafted some discussions of digital history projects and
digital tools into my existing, otherwise conventional [methods
seminar](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/methods-in-us-cultural-history.html).
On some aspects of digital history, I have students who know far more
than I do.

These confessions may make you wonder why I'm even on this panel. I
wondered too when Sharon Leon asked me to join. I *think* I'm here,
however, because my situation is probably fairly typical. Many of us
find ourselves wanting to know more about digital history, or at least
feeling like our students should know more about it, but we lack
institutional precedent, resources, individual experience, or even all
three. That's the situation I want to speak to today: how do you teach
methods that you are just learning about yourself?

Now, to put the question that way shows that this conversation about
*digital* history education immediately raises larger questions about
training graduate students in general. Let me lay my cards on the table
by saying that my own teaching philosophy doesn't regard my own areas of
ignorance as problems so much as opportunities. Often, my role as a
graduate instructor is to model informed befuddlement about history, to
be actively not-knowing in front of students and then to demonstrate how
I learn and think about something new to me.

Indeed, that's what I want to do in this roundtable: to think out loud
about *teaching* methods that are still new to me. Instead of expertise,
what I want to offer---in the spirit of the New Year---are several
*resolutions* I've made about teaching digital history with some
thoughts-in-progress about how it's gone so far.

My first resolution: *I resolve to share with students my own reasons
for interest in digital history.* My masterclass began, as many classes
do, with my asking students why they were taking the class; but it also
started with my telling them [why I was teaching
it](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/why-study-digital-history.html). In my
case, I started to become interested in digital history when I realized
that I was already a digital historian whether I wanted to be or
not---that is, when I realized that I rely heavily for my work on
digital databases and digital tools whose workings I needed to better
understand. In your case, you may feel a professional obligation to talk
about digital skills given that an increasing number of job ads mention
them and an increasing number of careers require them. But whatever your
reasons for being here might be, you can resolve to be open with
students about them. I've found that this simple step is not a bad way
to get quickly into some of the debates at the center of the digital
humanities.

My second resolution: *I resolve to encourage students to build an
online presence.* In both of my graduate seminars, students create blogs
in which they write about course readings and projects, and many
students also join Twitter. This has two important effects. First, it
extends our classroom by connecting students with practicing digital
historians at other institutions who are more expert than I. Second, the
practice of running a simple blog or website and playing around with
it---changing themes, installing Wordpress plugins, tweaking CSS and
HTML---can be a good preparation for learning about more complex digital
history tools and encourage more reflective use of things like search
engines and databases.[^1]

Third, *I resolve to assign some digital history projects and articles
as part of the reading for my courses.* Even if students in a particular
course do not make a digital project, they can learn how to examine and
evaluate articles and websites that do make extensive use of digital
methods. So, for example, in my methods in social and cultural history
course, placing a couple of articles that do rudimentary text mining on
the syllabus exposes students to such work and again encourages
reflection on the way they themselves use keyword searching or databases
like Google Books.

My fourth resolution: *I resolve to learn from graduate students and
colleagues from outside my department.* I have to say that I've learned
a ton just from reading the tutorials and blogs of graduate students in
classes like [the one Fred Gibbs
teaches](http://www.fredgibbs.net/clio3workspace/blog/) at George Mason.
I consider blogging graduate students like [Cameron
Blevins](http://www.cameronblevins.org), [Jeri
Wieringa](http://jeriwieringa.com), and [Benjamin
Schmidt](http://bmschmidt.wordpress.com) my digital hisory teachers. And
at my own institution, many students and staff members have more
expertise on GIS software or web server administration than I. Training
others in these methods requires being trained, and a willingness---as
[Stephen Ramsay once put
it](http://stephenramsay.us/text/2010/10/08/care-of-the-soul.html)---to
sometimes be "the dumbest person in the room."

And finally, *I resolve to be open with students about my own research and
learning process.* If students are often reluctant to try new things and fail,
who can blame them if we are too? That's why, when I recently used part of
a leave to learn some computer programming skills, [I blogged about the
experience](http://digitalhistory.blogs.rice.edu/category/python/) for my
masterclass. It's also why, in my methods course, I shared with students the
history of my first article, from outline to seminar paper to publication.
I not only gave them access to every rough draft of the paper that I wrote, but
also showed them reader's reports (both from the first, rejected submission and
the second, accepted one) and the methods I used to keep my research notes
along the way. This meant, of course, talking with them about dead ends, false
starts, and things I wish I had known then about organizing notes or keeping
citations.

My goal here was both to demystify the publishing process for them and
to demonstrate that it's OK---and inevitable---to feel lost at certain
points along the way. Perhaps that does not seem immediately relevant to
teaching digital history, but I've found, as [Ramsay has also
said](http://stephenramsay.us/2012/06/10/learning-to-program.html), that
learning about computers and digital methods requires not so much
special expertise or experience as it does a willingness to fail in
public, an ability to endure error messages and push through frustrating
problems. To the extent that I can make myself and my graduate students
less paralyzed by the new and more comfortable with the struggle, I can
begin to train them in digital history.

[^1]: This, at least, has been my own experience: starting my own blog
    as a graduate student made me roughly familiar with things like HTML
    and Javascript; like a tumbleweed, I picked up bits and pieces of
    knowledge along the way that have accumulated into the skill set I
    now have.
