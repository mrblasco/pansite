% Communicating with Professors
% W. Caleb McDaniel
% September 4, 2012

The best parts of my college experience were the relationships I built
with individual professors. In my very first semester, for example, I
took an introductory logic course with [Colin Allen][], now at Indiana
University. I loved the logic, but even more important for my
development as a student were the conversations I had with Allen outside
of class, on topics ranging from science to computer programming to the
philosophy of religion.

I still remember vividly the night, only a few weeks into my college career,
when Allen suggested we grab a sandwich at Subway to continue a conversation
that had spilled outside into the hall after class. I had something else to do
that night and had to decline, but that openness to communication meant
everything to me. It gave me the confidence to correspond with him by email on
matters mundane and serious. And most of all, it meant that I approached future
relationships with faculty unafraid to start conversations and express my
views.

I hope every undergraduate can have similar experiences, but my
experience on the other side of the desk, as it were, suggests that they
are rarer than they need to be. Sometimes this is because students don't
approach faculty in the first place, limiting their engagement to
whatever they get as part of the general class population. Other times
it is because some easy mistakes lead to miscommunications or awkward
first impressions that create static on the line between student and
professor.

This semester I prepared a brief presentation for undergraduates on "How
to Communicate with Professors," hoping to head off common problems and
demystify the process. My hope is that by getting brass tacks out of the
way, the sort of conversations that meant so much to me as an
undergraduate will be more comfortable for the students I know.

You can view the [slideshow][] for the presentation and get the [source

containing advice gathered from Twitter on this topic. Thanks to all
those who offered their advice and turned out for the presentation.
